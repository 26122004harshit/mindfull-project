        </div>
        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 1</h2>
                <img src="img/suprise-note.webp" width="100%" height="auto" alt="task1">
                <h3>Leave a Surprise Note</h3>
                <p>Don’t underestimate the power of a quick handwritten note with encouraging or kind words. Try tucking a Post-it note with ‘Today will be a good day ;)’ inside your child’s lunch box, or our favorite: surprise your partner with a heartfelt ‘You mean the world to me’ note left inside the book they’re currently reading.</p>
               
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 2</h2>
                <img src="img/billing-line.webp" width="100%" height="auto" alt="task2">
                <h3>Pay for the Person Behind You in Line</h3>
                <p>There are times when an act of kindness multiplies beyond anyone’s expectation. During December last year at a Dairy Queen in Minnesota, USA, one person paid for the meal of the person behind them, and it kicked off a massive chain reaction that involved over 900 cars ‘paying it forward’ and lasted over two and a half days! Why not be the first to pay for the person behind you in line and watch the happiness spread? Another way to achieve this is with a Gift Card!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 3</h2>
                <img src="img/active-listening.webp" width="100%" height="auto" alt="task3">
                <h3>Be an Active Listener</h3>
                <p>Sometimes, all someone wants is to have a chat, and to have someone who will listen - really listen. You don’t need to give advice, try to ‘solve the problem’, or make your friend feel better. Just listen and give the other person room to vent.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 4</h2>
                <img src="img/complement.webp" width="100%" height="auto" alt="task4">
                <h3>Give a Genuine Compliment</h3>
                <p>An easy way to make someone happy and boost their self-esteem is to give a genuine compliment. Try noticing something that your colleague has achieved lately, or watch the way they do a task and praise them for it. Maybe a friend is trying out a new hairstyle? Tell them they look radiant today.</p>
              
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 5</h2>
                <img src="img/random-people.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="task5">
                <h3>Greet Strangers</h3>
                <p>Eye contact, a smile, a quick nod of the head, a brief wave. There are many ways you can greet strangers without starting a conversation - and all of them will instantly brighten their day.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 6</h2>
                <img src="img/laugh.webp" width="100%" height="auto" alt="task6">
                <h3>Make Someone Laugh</h3>
                <p>You don’t have to be a comedian to make someone laugh. Print off your favorite joke and tell it to your colleague, or pull a funny face in front of your neighbor’s kid when you see them next. Laughter is a surefire way to break someone’s bad mood and turn a scowl into a smile.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 7</h2>
                <img src="img/positive.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="task7">
                <h3>Think Positively</h3>
                <p>Just by being aware of your own negative thoughts and making the conscious effort to concentrate on the positives will make you happier. And the best part? Having a sunny disposition is contagious. Additionally, wear a Tote Bag with a positive message or an Affirmation Pendant Necklace to spread positivity in confidence.</p>
                
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 8</h2>
                <img src="img/manners.webp" width="100%" height="auto" alt="task8">
                <h3>Use Your Manners</h3>
                <p>Saying please and thank you may sound silly, but remembering to use your manners and be polite really does make a difference to someone. Hopping off the bus? Why not thank the driver and show that you appreciate their service?</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 9</h2>
                <img src="img/knowledge.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="task9">
                <h3>Pass on Your Knowledge</h3>
                <p>If you have something you’re especially good at - speaking Spanish, sewing, woodworking, baking bread - why not hold an informal (and free) class and teach others what you’ve learnt? A skill-swap is an easy way to empower others and spread happiness.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 10</h2>
                <img src="img/selfcare.jpg" width="100%" height="26%" alt="task10">
                <h3>Practice Self-Care</h3>
                <p>It may sound counter-intuitive but when you focus on your own happiness, you will make others happy too. Treat yourself to a massage, take a long bath, spend five minutes every morning journaling. For those who like to splurge on fine jewelry, try buying Pearl Jewelry or 9K & 14K Gold Jewelry. When you feel good, you will naturally spread happiness and positivity to those around you.</p>
               
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 11</h2>
                <img src="img/bake.jpg" width="100%" height="28%" alt="task11">
                <h3>Bake Something</h3>
                <p>Who doesn’t love receiving home baked goods? Bring in warm chocolate muffins for your co-workers and see how many smiles you receive around the office!</p>
              
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 12</h2>
                <img src="img/homemade.jpg" width="100%" height="25%" alt="task12">
                <h3>Make a Homemade Gift Instead of Buying One</h3>
                <p>Why not make your own card with a heartfelt message inside for your friend’s next birthday? Or you could glue together a collage of images that remind you of them. A homemade gift shows you’ve really thought about the person you’re giving it to. Alternatively, you can buy a memorable gift like Personalized Jewelry.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 13</h2>
                <img src="img/task13.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="task13">
                <h3>Make a Playlist for Someone</h3>
                <p>Listening to music is a quick and easy way to boost your mood, so why not share the happiness and make a playlist for someone else? Share your favorite tracks with your best friend, your sister, or a colleague, and bring a little sunshine into their day.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 14</h2>

                <h3>Send an Old-Fashioned Letter</h3>
                <p>There’s something special about receiving a handwritten letter. The time it takes to pen down your thoughts and the surprise of receiving a letter in the post will bring a smile to anyone’s face.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
                <h2>Task 15</h2>
                <img src="img/task15.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="task15">
                <h3>Give an Unexpected Hug</h3>
                <p>Sometimes, an unexpected hug can brighten someone’s day. It’s a simple gesture that shows you care and appreciate them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="card1">
